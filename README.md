# Controlling Onboard LED and Push Button via GPIO; Focus on the Use of the Oscilloscope

This repository contains the source code and documentation for Lab 4 of the ENGR 478: Design with Microprocessors course (Spring 2025).
The lab focuses on using the SysTick timer and external interrupts (EXTI) to control an LED on the STM32L476RG Nucleo-64 board, with additional implementation of software debouncing for push-button input.

## üõ† Features

- Toggle LD2 (PA5) using **SysTick** every 1 second.
- Detect **PC13 button press** using EXTI interrupt.
- **Override SysTick** behavior while the button is pressed (LED stays ON).
- **Resume blinking** once the button is released.
- **Software debouncing** implemented to filter mechanical bounce (adaptive delay).
- Modular code: `led.c`, `systick_timer.c`, and `button.c` for clarity and reuse.
